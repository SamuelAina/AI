"Astronomers capture new images of Jupiter using 'lucky' technique Astronomers have captured some of the highest resolution images of Jupiter ever obtained from the ground using a technique known as ‚Äúlucky imaging‚Äù. The observations, from the Gemini North telescope on Hawaii‚Äôs dormant volcano Mauna Kea, reveal lightning strikes and storm systems forming around deep clouds of water ice and liquid. The images show the warm, deep layers of the planet‚Äôs atmosphere glowing through gaps in thick cloud cover in a ‚Äújack-o-lantern‚Äù-like effect. ‚ÄúThe Gemini data were critical because they allowed us to probe deeply into Jupiter‚Äôs clouds on a regular schedule,‚Äù said Michael Wong of University of California, Berkeley, who led the research team. ‚ÄúWe used a very powerful technique called lucky imaging.‚Äù The technique involves obtaining a large number of very short exposure images and then only using the sharpest ones, when the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is briefly stable, and discarding the rest. The latest observations provide some of the sharpest infrared images of Jupiter ever obtained from the ground. ‚ÄúThese images rival the view from space,‚Äù said Wong.",0
"Weatherwatch: what is the dew point? The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air‚Äôs moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere. Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air‚Äôs dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.",0
"Nike shoes that have revolutionised marathon times unlikely to be banned The World Athletics working group investigating the Nike shoes which have revolutionised marathon times is still deliberating over what limits to place on the carbon plate and foam technology and is unlikely to implement a wholesale ban. The Guardian understands the group met again on Wednesday and intends to announce its findings by the end of the month. But sources suggest that, contrary to headlines about the shoes being banned, the issue remains under debate. As things stand, the group‚Äôs emphasis appears more on putting limits to the future incarnations of the technology, which was first introduced in 2016, rather than restricting the Vaporfly shoes completely. One option under consideration is to put limits on the size of the foam midsoles in all shoes, something that would make the next‚Äëgeneration AlphaFly shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge in his sub-two‚Äëhour marathon run in Vienna illegal. Kipchoge insists that focusing on his Nike shoes is wrong. ‚ÄúThey are fair,‚Äù he told the Telegraph. ‚ÄúI trained hard. Technology is growing and we can‚Äôt deny it ‚Äì we must go with technology.‚Äù There have also been suggestions that similar shoe technology was used to power Laura Muir‚Äôs spikes on the track last year. However, sources close to her say that is ‚Äúcategorically‚Äù not the case.",0

"Country diary: lilies marooned from the glacial story Mere glitter dazzles between air and water, disrupting shadows of the surrounding woods, distracting the eye, hovering over occult secrets underwater. The outer world is sedated by bright autumn sunshine while under the surface is a troubled subconscious that gives the place the ‚Äúdiscouragement‚Äù, the ‚Äúunbreathing quiet‚Äù that Mary Webb attributed to the fictitious Sarn Mere in her novel Precious Bane. Colemere is one of a sentence of meres written by dying ice at the end of its age 10,000 years ago. Down in the thick of the water are woods of weed haunted by carp, and fates with names such as ‚ÄúJenny Greenteeth‚Äù that pull you in. Along the shoreline, where whirligig beetles draw orbital ripples, roots the least water lily, Nuphar pumila, which is similar to the yellow water lily but much smaller; its floating leaves have a bay in them, its stigma discs are starry and remain at the ends of brandy-flask seedheads. This little colony is a relict population; the next nearest to Colemere is in Scotland. They are marooned from the glacial story in a kind of magical substance between land and water, an ecology surviving in Shropshire‚Äôs meres and mosses, and now hanging on in the Anthropocene‚Äôs red list of endangered species. The water lily needs acidic water, open skies and glittering sunlight, and is doomed by the encroaching shoreline shadow of trees, toxic run-off from fields and canal spill. Some years ago, such pollution killed swan mussels, Anodonta cygnea, beautiful 20cm oval shells, like clasped cigarette cases, concealing the gentle sole of a creature that walks underwater; it is hard to imagine a more fragile innocence poisoned by our spit. The pixels of mere glitter can change into dragonfly or goldeneye, snipe or pochard; their twinkle is forever new, as if the place ‚Äúwas created but an hour gone, and not created for us‚Äù, as Webb says. A heron stands with studied indifference at the sailing club compound of parked dinghies, neatly sheeted to stow their playfully nautical traditions and the thrill of capsize. The mere is all so peaceful-looking but it is a place where ‚Äúthe moon would get lost in lily leaves, and times, a heron might stand in the sun‚Äù.",0
"Kim-Joy's recipe for sugar glass heart biscuits Make these for Valentine‚Äôs Day (or any day of the year) for your friends, family and loved ones. You can pipe their names on to the biscuits to personalise them. People will love the effort you have gone to. Makes: 12 (plus centre cutouts) For the biscuit dough 200g salted butter 85g caster sugar 270g plain flour For the sugar glass 250g caster sugar 165g liquid glucose 55g water For the royal icing 100g icing sugar 20g egg white Plus extra icing sugar and egg white to adjust consistency if needed Plus Sprinkles of your choice Edible silver/gold paint To make the dough, beat together the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until smooth and fluffy. Add the flour and mix until just combined. The dough should be slightly sticky, but soft and easy to handle. If necessary, wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for 10 to 15 minutes or until firm enough to roll out. Turn out on to a well-floured surface and roll out to about 3mm/‚Öõin thick. Use a large circle cutter to cut out 12 shapes, and transfer to a lined baking tray (which you can fit in the fridge). Use a smaller heart-shaped cutter to stamp out the centres. You can place the centres on another baking tray and bake them, too. Refrigerate for 15 minutes, while you heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on the baking tray, then gently transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. When the biscuits are cool, place them on greaseproof paper, then make the sugar glass. Put the sugar, liquid glucose and water in a small saucepan. Stir to combine. Heat on high, and don‚Äôt stir until the mixture reaches 150C. At this point, remove the pan from the heat and use a large spoon to transfer the sugar syrup into the centres of the biscuits. Immediately scatter over sprinkles. Leave the sugar syrup for about 20 minutes until hardened completely, then peel off the greaseproof paper. Make the royal icing; whisk together the icing sugar and egg white until smooth and a pipeable consistency. Transfer to a piping bag and snip a small opening. Pipe dots and hearts on your biscuits. You can also personalise them by piping names. Once the icing has semi-set (about two hours), you can paint it with a little edible silver/gold paint.",0
"Belfast shooting: three men arrested Three men have been arrested in Belfast in connection with the murder of a man in the north of the city earlier on Saturday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the three suspects were taken to Musgrave Street police station in central Belfast for questioning on Saturday evening. The PSNI also said that the murdered man was shot several times during the gun attack in the Ardoyne district around 11.50am on Saturday. A councillor whose constituency includes the Ardoyne district where the fatal shooting occurred said a number of children were playing nearby when the man was shot dead. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there was no excuse for this ‚Äúabhorrent and brutal crime‚Äù, adding that it was ‚Äúparticularly thoughtless at a time when our emergency services are already working increasingly hard to keep us all safe dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic‚Äù. The victim was killed in the front garden of a house in Etna Drive in Ardoyne. Local sources said they did not believe the killing had a sectarian motive, and that the victim was not from the area. Paul McCusker, an SDLP councillor for north Belfast, said a number of people living in Etna Drive tried to save the victim after he was shot. ‚ÄúOne man from Etna Drive tried to use CPR to revive him but to no avail while other neighbours in the street comforted him until the emergency services came,‚Äù he said. McCusker said it was deeply disturbing that young children playing in their front gardens while locked down at home due to the coronavirus crisis may have witnessed the shooting. ‚ÄúThis brutal crime has caused immense shock in Ardoyne. My thoughts are with this man‚Äôs family at an incredibly difficult time. ‚ÄúI also think that this will compound the already massive pressure on people living here who are having problems coping with self-isolation and lockdown,‚Äù he said. Investigating officers had locked down large parts of the area surrounding the location of the shooting, he added, urging the public to cooperate with the police. A car believed to have been used in the killing was found on fire a short distance away in Ardoyne on Jamaica Street. Gerry Kelly, the Sinn F√©in member of the legislative assembly for North Belfast, also condemned the shooting. ‚ÄúI would appeal for calm at this time in the area and stress that anybody with any information about this horrific incident should bring it immediately to the PSNI,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúActions like this have no place in our society and I repeat my condemnation of those involved. ‚ÄúAt a time when all frontline statutory agencies and indeed communities are doing what they can to fight against Covid-19 this just adds to the suffering unfortunately being experienced by local people at this time.‚Äù",1

"Kim-Joy's recipe for lemon and rose tofu cheesecake This cheesecake is made with tofu, which gives it a nice and creamy texture. It‚Äôs a great option if you have silken tofu in your cupboard, but are short on fresh ingredients such as cream. It tastes different to a standard cheesecake as it is less ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù, but I enjoy both. You can always substitute some of the silken tofu for vegan or dairy cream cheese. I enjoy the simplicity of this version, which lets the lemon and rosewater flavours shine. The edible petal decorations are an optional extra and can be arranged however you like. Serves six to eight For the biscuit base 180g digestive biscuits (or use any sweet, plain biscuit) 80g melted dairy or vegan butter (or 70g melted coconut oil ‚Äì if you use coconut oil it won‚Äôt look liquid enough to set firm in the fridge, but it will set firmer than the butter option after a couple of hours) Alternative biscuit base (vegan and gluten-free) 125g dates 125g blanched almonds (you can substitute other nuts and adjust quantities for desired sweetness) Pinch of salt 15g melted coconut oil (or melted vegan butter) For the cheesecake 675g silken tofu (or you can use cream cheese ‚Äì vegan or dairy) 190g caster or granulated sugar 1¬Ω tbsp cornflour ¬º tsp rosewater (optional) 1¬Ω tbsp coconut oil (or use melted butter ‚Äì vegan or dairy) Grated rind of two lemons (or any citrus fruit) For the petal decorations (optional) White edible wafer paper Food dyes: brown, pink, yellow Heat the oven to 180C/160C (fan)/350F. Place the biscuits in a sandwich bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into fine crumbs. Place in a bowl and pour over the melted butter/coconut oil. Stir together until the crumbs look evenly coated, and then press into the base of a 9in round ovenproof dish. Alternatively, you can make the vegan and gluten-free version. Place the dates in a food processor and blitz until they are sticky and form a ball. Add the blanched almonds, a pinch of salt and coconut oil, and blitz again until combined. Press this mixture into your dish. For the cheesecake, use a food processor to blend the tofu until smooth (or use cream cheese). Remove a couple of tablespoons and whisk this together with the cornflour in a separate bowl. Add back to the main mixture, along with the caster sugar, rosewater (optional), melted coconut oil and grated lemon rind. Mix together again until smooth and combined. Pour over the biscuit base, and then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until slightly coloured at the edges and there is still a slight wobble in the centre. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge to finish cooling. Meanwhile, make the edible decorations. Cut simple petal shapes from the wafer paper, then use a paintbrush to very lightly wet these. Paint using food dye mixed with a little water. When the wafer paper is wet, you will be able to shape it so that it looks more realistic. For the stem make a long stem shape painted brown. When you‚Äôre happy with your petals and stem, leave to dry for a few hours. They will go hard and be easy to pick up. Decorate the fully chilled cheesecake with the petal decorations, then serve and enjoy.",0
"Ammonium nitrate: what is the chemical blamed for blast in Lebanese capital? The likely cause of the huge blast in Beirut on Tuesday appears to have been the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate. Lebanon‚Äôs prime minister, Hassan Diab, said 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded after lying unsecured in a warehouse for six years, tallying with reports that a ship carrying a similar quantity of the chemical had unloaded its cargo at the port in 2013. It remains unclear what caused the chemical to ignite. Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives. It is not used as an explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser and makes a fire more intense, according to Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne. However, da Silva said, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. ‚ÄúYou need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,‚Äù he said. While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened here,‚Äù said da Silva. While the chemicals in the air should dissipate fairly quickly, lingering pollutants can cause problems later, for example if they acidify rain. ‚ÄúIf you look at the smoke that came from the blast it‚Äôs this kind of blood red colour. That‚Äôs because of the nitrogen oxide air pollutants in it,‚Äù he said. If the 2,700-tonne figure is accurate, that would make the ammonium nitrate explosion larger than the 1947 Texas City Disaster, when a consignment of 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded, killing nearly 500 people. The blast created a 4.5-metre (15ft) wave. The images coming out of Beirut are also horribly reminiscent of the destruction inflicted on the Chinese city of Tianjin by a 2015 warehouse disaster that killed more than 170 people and left hundreds injured. On the night of 12 August a series of cataclysmic detonations rocked an area of warehouses where large quantities of hazardous chemicals, also including sodium cyanide and potassium nitrate, were being stored, in some cases illegally. Chinese authorities later claimed the first explosion had been triggered when the summer heat caused a highly flammable compound called nitrocellulose to spontaneously ignite. Nearby stores of ammonium nitrate then caught fire and exploded in the major port city, which lies 110km (70 miles) south-east of the capital Beijing. Firefighters who rushed to the scene reportedly attempted to extinguish the initial blaze with water ‚Äì only to inadvertently exacerbate the situation because of the presence of hazardous flammable chemicals. The majority of those killed were firefighters, including at least one teenager. Such was the force of the Tianjin explosions that they registered as small earthquakes. Then, as now, witnesses filmed apocalyptic, almost surreal footage showing the scale of the inferno. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 13 August 2020 to remove a reference to the 1947 Texas City explosion causing a ‚Äútidal‚Äù wave, and to clarify some of the properties of ammonium nitrate.",0
"Los Angeles explosion: 11 firefighters hurt as 'hash oil factory' burns An explosion in downtown Los Angeles has injured 11 firefighters, with scores more sent to put out the blaze in what was described as a factory making cannabis oil. Captain Erik Scott of the Los Angeles fire department said ‚Äúone significant explosion‚Äù shook the neighborhood around 6.30pm on Saturday and as first responders arrived they saw firefighters emerge from the building with burns and other injuries. Some of their uniforms were on fire. Four firefighters were taken to a burns intensive care unit, two were put on ventilators due to signs of swelling airways and the other five who were hospitalized suffering a range of burns. The two firefighters on ventilators appeared to have inhaled superheated gases but as of around 10pm local time it seemed none of the injuries were life-threatening, said the fire department‚Äôs medical director, Marc Eckstein. Firefighters were initially called to 327 East Boyd Street in the city‚Äôs Toy District for a report of a fire at a one-storey commercial building. The LA fire department issued a ‚Äúmayday‚Äù call, which means a firefighter is missing, down or trapped, and characterised the blaze as a ‚Äúmajor emergency‚Äù with more than 230 firefighters responding. The fire spread to several nearby buildings but by 7.15pm appeared largely under control. When the firefighters first entered the building before the explosion they saw ‚Äúlight to moderate smoke‚Äù, but also noticed that the pressure and heat was increasing inside, said fire chief Ralph M Terrazas: ‚ÄúThings didn‚Äôt seem right.‚Äù The firefighters moved to evacuate at this point and as they were starting to exit, the ‚Äúexplosion or flash‚Äù occurred, prompting the mayday call, he said. Some of their coats caught fire. Scott described the business as a maker of ‚Äúbutane honey oil.‚Äù Butane is a flammable gas. Making the oil involves extracting the high-inducing chemical THC from cannabis plants to create a highly potent concentrate also known as hash oil. The oil is used in vape pens, edibles, waxes and other products. Small butane canisters were later found on the street, officials said. The business where the explosion erupted may have been a wholesale distributor but the nature of the operation and the cause of the fire were still under investigation late Saturday evening. ‚ÄúWe have every expectation the firefighters will pull through,‚Äù Eckstein told reporters, noting that all firefighters were awake and alert upon arrival to the hospital. ‚ÄúIt could‚Äôve been much, much worse.‚Äù Eckstein said there were no Covid-19 patients in the unit where the firefighters were being treated but the hospital was taking precautions to protect them. Terrazas said the department was providing mental health services for the impacted first responders: ‚ÄúA lot of our firefighters were traumatized. You can imagine the amount of emotional stress.‚Äù Jeralyn Cleveland told the Los Angeles Times she was on a roof of an apartment building a few blocks away when she saw the explosion: ‚ÄúEveryone in my building thought there was a bomb that went off. It was like a mushroom.‚Äù The site of the fire was not far from Skid Row, a downtown LA neighborhood that is the epicenter of the city‚Äôs homelessness crisis.",1
"Whatever floats your boat? Scientists defy gravity with levitating liquid Scientists have turned the world upside down with a curious quirk of physics that allowed them to float toy boats the wrong way up beneath a levitating body of liquid. In a striking demonstration of the mind-bending effect, the boats seem to defy the laws of gravity as they bob about on the water above them with their sails pointing down. The bizarre phenomenon makes for a nifty trick, but researchers say the finding may have practical implications, from mineral processing to separating waste and pollutants from water and other liquids. ‚ÄúWe were playing around,‚Äù said Emmanuel Fort, a researcher on the team that discovered the effect at the Higher School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. ‚ÄúWe had no idea it would work.‚Äù The scientists made their finding while studying the curious impact vibrations can have on the behaviour of liquids. Researchers already knew that, given the right kind of vibrations, bubbles can plunge downwards in liquids, while heavy particles that would normally settle out float to the surface instead. Another strange effect of vibrations allows a layer of liquid to float in air, provided it is in a closed container. The explanation lies in the ability of vibrations to stabilise what are otherwise unstable systems. If a container holding a runny liquid is swiftly flipped over, the liquid will fall to the bottom. The liquid does not fall in one go, however. Instead, droplets first form on the underside of the liquid, which instigate the rest of the liquid‚Äôs collapse. But set the container on a vibrating plate and the liquid can behave very differently. Vertical shaking at the right frequency prevents the droplets forming. Without them, the liquid remains aloft: instead of falling, it rests on the cushion of air. This much was already known. What Fort and his colleagues showed was that objects could experience an ‚Äúantigravity‚Äù effect and float in the underside of the levitated liquid. Writing in Nature, they demonstrate this with small toy boats floating in levitating layers of glycerol and silicon oil. A number of forces keep the boats in place. The first comes from air pressure, which is raised by the weight of the liquid above, and pushes the boat up into the water. But the liquid pushes back on the boat itself, a force that decreases higher up the layer. Gravity also pulls the boat down. It all makes for a delicate balance that could fall apart at any moment, were it not for the vibrations. ‚ÄúIf you move the boat down in the air it will fall, and if you move it up, it will go up to the interface. The whole trick is not only to make the situation possible in the first place, but to stabilise the equilibrium,‚Äù Fort said. The researchers believe the work opens up new avenues for study, and suspect the effect might be useful for industrial processes, such as removing plastic particles from liquids. But for now, the scientists are simply enjoying the weird effect. ‚ÄúThe fun thing is that it triggers reactions from people who aren‚Äôt scientific,‚Äù Fort said. ‚ÄúPeople say it‚Äôs like the scene in Pirates of the Caribbean when the boat floats upside down. It‚Äôs counterintuitive. It gets people talking about science fiction and fantasy and that is very nice.‚Äù",0
"'The initial reaction was just joy': window therapy brings light to aged care residents Once a week, Benhur Helwend sanitises his ukulele, meticulously washes his hands and slaps on a cheery boater hat to prepare for a new kind of performance. The punters who‚Äôll gather to hear him play are residents at an aged care home on Sydney‚Äôs north shore. And depending which way you look at it, either Helwend or his audience members are behind glass. This is window therapy ‚Äì a way of engaging elderly people with the arts (and a good singalong) while physical distancing restrictions are in place. Musician and actor Benhur Helwend adds colour to the windows ‚ÄúUsually I start by drawing a big gigantic love heart on the window, and then I write ‚ÄòI miss you‚Äô,‚Äù Helwend says, outlining a new performance kit that includes liquid chalk markers as well as huge amounts of window cleaner. ‚ÄúThe residents are in their common room and they are facing the window, and I‚Äôm on the other side with a microphone and a little PA. It‚Äôs very difficult for me to hear them, so a lot of it is very visual. I‚Äôll draw the songs a bit like Pictionary, and they have to guess the tune we are about to sing.‚Äù Helwend is primarily a musician and actor (you might have seen him in ABC‚Äôs Les Norton last year), and laughs while describing his illustration powers as ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù. Still, he is slowly developing the ability to write backwards, and has started incorporating what he calls ‚ÄúMr Squiggle‚Äù elements into the shows at Whiddon Hornsby: residents place their hands on the window, then he traces around and creates drawings from their handprints. But Helwend‚Äôs main point of connection is through song, and after three years of closeup visits to this facility ‚Äì plus more than a decade at other aged care homes ‚Äì he knows which tunes will get feet tapping, even at a distance. The Whiddon Hornsby crowd are big fans of Doris Day tunes, Helwend says. Alongside What a Wonderful World, You Are My Sunshine, and Aussie standards such as Waltzing Matilda and the Happy Little Vegemites jingle. The window therapy shows were, Helwend admits, ‚Äúa bit shaky at first‚Äù. Uncertain of even leaving the house at the beginning of lockdown, he was also ‚Äúterrified of potentially exposing a resident‚Äù. Even so, those early performances were ‚Äúincredibly emotional‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúThe initial reaction was just joy. I would sing a song and, despite me not hearing their reactions, I could see them singing along or tapping their feet. They were connecting with the music ‚Ä¶ even just a finger tap or a toe tap is enough.‚Äù Staff, too, notice the difference. ‚ÄúOur residents love their creative engagement sessions with Benhur, and are thrilled that these can still take place during visitor restrictions ‚Äì albeit through the window,‚Äù says the facility‚Äôs director of care services, Sally Martin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so important, particularly at this time, to keep their spirits up and keep them engaged through play and fun.‚Äù Now with six weeks of performances under his belt, Helwend says he finds great satisfaction in maintaining connections with his ‚Äúelders‚Äù through a sheet of glass ‚Äì and he‚Äôs not alone. Benhur Helwend beckons one of the residents to come to the window. Coronavirus restrictions have prompted the formation of the Outside In Collective (AKA ‚ÄúBoredom Force‚Äù), a loose coalition of creatives who work in aged care facilities, engaging residents with the arts. Founder Maurie Voisey-Barlin came up with the idea of window therapy and was quick to spread it around. Together, the collective is providing window therapy at 10 sites across New South Wales. For Helwend, the weekly bookings are meaningful work. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm contributing to the happiness of people in the last stage of their lives,‚Äù he says. And why is window therapy so important? The best answer is in the lyrics of one of his favourite songs, Hello in There by John Prine, Helwend says. ‚ÄúOld people just grow lonesome,‚Äù he sings. ‚ÄúWaiting for someone to say, ‚ÄòHello in there, hello‚Äô.‚Äù",0
