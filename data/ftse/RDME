Give me HTML and javascript for an APP to be called "Bin2" that takes a file selected by the user and converts the content to Base 64 encoding. There should be a textarea box in which the encoded text should be displayed. There should be the following other buttons:
[Paste] - to paste text into the textarea.
[Copy] - to copy the content of the textarea.
[Save] - to convert the content of the textarea into binary and save it to a file name to be provided by user
