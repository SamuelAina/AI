I need your help to complete the migration of the AvF Tracker from CD01 to CD04.

We could not migrate it mainly due to connectivity with XLCubed reports. 

We were going through the process of sorting out the connection but we did not complete it.

If you give me the stored procedures behind the reports I can make the changes.

List of reports accessed from the tracker:

1, Exec Summary
http://...

2, Regional/Product Summary
http://...

3, Status Report
http://...

4, FX Report
http://...


5, AvF Rec Report
http://...


6, Daily FX Predictor
http://...

7, FY 2013 AvF
http://...

8, AvF Exec Summary - Power BI Report Server (scb.net)
https://...


I also see that there are some DataMart based tables and views which I presume to be used for further reporting. I will need your assistance to restanlish connectivities to them as part of the migration.

Please let me know when you are available to discuss this matter.
