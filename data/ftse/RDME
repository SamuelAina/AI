Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002AE998C2E50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')': /simple/requests/
==============π=°°

This error message typically indicates a network connectivity issue when trying to use `pip` to install a package. Here’s a breakdown of the error components and potential solutions:

1. **Error Explanation:**
   - `Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None))`: This part indicates that there are no retries left for the connection attempt. The `total=0` means it won't retry anymore.
   - `connection broken by 'NewConnectionError'`: This suggests that a new connection could not be established.
   - `Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed'`: This indicates a DNS error, meaning the system could not resolve the hostname for the URL provided.

2. **Potential Causes:**
   - **Internet Connectivity:** Your internet connection might be down or unstable.
   - **DNS Issues:** There might be a problem with your DNS server, preventing hostname resolution.
   - **Firewall or Proxy Settings:** A firewall or proxy might be blocking the connection.
   - **Incorrect URL or Configuration:** There might be a typo or misconfiguration in your pip settings or the URL you are trying to access.

3. **Solutions:**
   - **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure your device is connected to the internet and that other websites are accessible.
   - **Verify DNS Settings:** Try changing your DNS settings to use a public DNS server like Google’s (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare’s (1.1.1.1).
   - **Adjust Firewall/Proxy Settings:** Check if your firewall or proxy settings are blocking pip. You might need to adjust these settings or use the `--proxy` option with pip if behind a proxy.
   - **Update pip Configuration:** Ensure that the pip configuration is correct. You can reset or update pip to the latest version using:
     ```sh
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - **Use a Different Source:** Try using a different package index or mirror by adding the `--index-url` option:
     ```sh
     pip install <package_name> --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
     ```

If you continue to experience issues, providing more details about your environment (e.g., operating system, pip version, network setup) might help in diagnosing the problem further.
