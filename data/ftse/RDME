I reviewed the process and didn’t find any issues.

To monitor file download attempts by the general download script, you can use the log table *CascadeDB.dbo.tbl_posweb_ratan_log*. Additionally, ensure that your script checks if the file is empty (0 bytes) before proceeding with processing.

As for the "randomly occurring issue," it’s best to diagnose the problem each time it occurs, as the cause may vary and may not always be related to the download script.
