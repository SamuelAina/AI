	Dear Team,
	
	I recently changed my password. As there  are some scripts used for auromatic file downloads requiring user authentication I have had to activate changes for the script using the procedure in the attached email.
	
	I am sending this email to you all so that other members of the team can activate the scripts with their own credentials if I am not available to carry out the process.
	
	Please, Note that Ratan File downloads require for the person who activates the script to have access to each of the report files on the report platform UUUURRRLLL
