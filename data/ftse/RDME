Tell us here just say bye bye in a nice way not that we want that but how are you anyway I'm good man I'm good that's the family yeah everybody do like most children there be if the boys are hunting hunting yes I think like you wanted back in your days two days I was just thinking about metal legs oh that's cool man so how's your work going these days he's still going he's just work isn't it it's all they've messed it all up with IR 35 and all this nonsense now got that yes we still have all that well this one let's edit you don't have a tax bill at the end of the year that's one good thing OK So what how is it with you so you don't do I have 35 anymore now that you do do I asset price you still go to IR 35 OK so how do you want them do you do what do you mean I mean every government contracts by default is pushed through after if I've got OK OK so that you don't have a say in the matter all that means is there take 52% of your salary rich yeah and then they are saved this time that is and you don't get holiday pay you end up the people that are on the proof list to employ you make you pay for everything so there's not much it much reason for them to employ apart from that but yeah it's it is what it is my cousins wife got a good job with the MOD public 35% into a pension pot no that's good yeah that's pretty good high amount that is not contract OK yes yeah she's not well it's a good thing she's going but she can't get paid is it because she's not well that she's getting that OK no OK you must have some special ask you 35% 35% OK I know those HR people they know it takes anyway PLP would normally have their own views with recruitment agencies as well imagine like estate agents yeah sorry estate agents there be known to be pumped 10,000 here there be interesting and yeah yeah yeah yeah but then I'm sure that it's the top level estate agents that do very well the the owners of the business and not necessarily the staff is something isn't it so it always like that but yeah we'll see what happens yeah So what you doing this weekend ah this weekend tomorrow will be taking the younger boy the younger son back to uni so which Tunisia Manchester

man at least I'm glad but we ought to maybe we ought to meet up sometimes yeah the old days remember we used to go to Chinatown at 4:30 in the morning yeah man full meal yeah and then walk out this over yeah yeah I remember it was good to have those times I don't know that restaurant is still open 24 hours though which one is that I can't remember the name it brings a chance that reason is changed everything is charged being yeah I have known the only thing that still remains is the golden dragon restaurant never do there but the food isn't as good as it used to be Once Upon a time waiting there about six weeks ago when we were in London well we went for dinner Chinatown we spent the day but I was made these how much it's changed it pedestrianised it now and yeah it's it's crazy all the old places are gone they got all these new street places that whole stretch is there used to be a place above the fire station that's closed that used to the best suit they used to the best dim sum yeah yeah they used to bring that trolley around oh imagine good old days yeah that's good OK but now I don't think so I think it's a different world there were together yeah it's not your age is starting to show now Charles started to sound old come on let's go out there rock the clubs man oh God now you're talking you're talking how you want young meat OK is hungry hungry for meat what about you they don't want younger mates she's still young we have to say he's pushing it let's be fair yeah this is still holding about you she still strong yeah yeah if I clean I would say Evergreen oh they're fine they all go OK they're doing fine I was particularly captured by the one that was at your birthday party that said there for your birthday previously when you in Nigeria you guys used to share a bottle of 7UP now who said that I think that was in my cousin that was my classmate he said it was a woman I must have been comforted then living comfort I know she said that that's how you used to send a big birthday I know maybe that was my sister your sister yes yes my sister yes I think that no I remember your sister yeah because my sister days I just one day apart I'm 20 his 21 September wow so I think it must have been hard that it was I've been the one that said that that we used to celebrate like that we we used to celebrate our birthdays together that's true yeah yeah yeah wow yeah and I think it was nice to come to your party the other time this all thank you it's a pity you want drinking he wanna talk behaviour with the wife that that we waiting for you you know what time we went to bed it was too early right it was 5 to 5 to 50 God manage that we couldn't have managed that what because what we were going somewhere I want to eat from there we were going to family friend in walking you should have just drunk off let your wife drive yeah I could have done that to the cop there OK maybe I should have yeah but I'm not sure he I think he would I'm not sure but now we can roll back we can roll back time and go back to the day though you can't really roll it out just load it out doesn't only talk like a mat I bumped into family somewhere at one point in the airport yeah is very tall taller than father George oh he saw me he said come right big man right now you are busy and is supporting MP4 wow NT four yeah species us they have customers on the legacy act which is still working on the VM and they're still keeping it going crazy after all these years and she's cool could you imagine Oh yes how come it's not upgraded it's windows isn't it yeah I would have thought that Microsoft would have patching it oh because I thought they would simply have moved on to the next operator to the next time fashion legacy app OK alright OK I got you so the legacy app will only work with NT4 crazy exactly crazy what kind of road map is that that's why road map man that's like it's like like lost in the ******* desert that's what it is if they have enough customers they they beach is big enough to go on to Microsoft you need to carry on patching this will give you money yeah maybe yeah that they would bring on their state would be torturous courage yeah but then on the other hand you know how it is in these companies how incompetent people get and their politics data yeah especially government institutions they just waste money and they don't believe they don't care that much about the system as long as it works they keep patching it up yeah that's how it's done just keep patching it up more even in bigger banks you probably will find that they're like 10 years behind in their systems you know it's crazy I know not the big banks do you the mainframe deserve it wow I don't think my bank those boys quite possible I think places like if I remember correctly the Bank of Scotland Royal Bank of Scotland not believe this they still make it obvious so prized but you know that there's been some changes to those banks anyway and they've all been developed turn into Lloyds Bank in the background so yeah yeah yeah all this Halifax Lloyds isn't it no I'm telling you do you have another fax account I don't know about but I used to back with voice but I didn't really like them there was actually clearly not Lloyd all right well I'm lucky I don't I don't it doesn't make a difference that you have their accounts and I said to him it's pretty much seamless but I know that at the background everything's been merged on the organised another the way it goes sometimes I think if we keep it's people in business if you look at Wales yeah most of the employment in Wales I've done by the council OK the council OK yeah couch employs a lot so caps has a same lot of things when you live in Wales very I'm very strict on recycling my God they got people that will come out go through your bin oh God yeah no I said that if somebody was to go through my bin now they will put in straight into gaol it will be one way ticket could be one way to get to something wow man oh are you planning to go back to Nigeria this year ah I'm going in November oh wow OK there's no pressure or it definitely a pleasure I I don't think I have business in Nigeria I wish I did well I don't think I could hack that but I'm going because a friend of mine he in my village yeah they they have this they have their ancestral family home and they they built it basically down only built it try one of the tribes that when someone dies they bury them in the front room partly yeah so they do that in my village yes so there's going to be problems but they they will build the house Ono that's different and I don't think in this case I don't think they built anybody in your premises becaused yeah they're quite that they're not I wouldn't say they are well to do but they are very well recognised in the village and he's very well done I very academic a lot and his dad was the first mathematics professor in Nigeria so there's a does a background and then we build a house and now they're throwing in celebration party all right so we're going there add on what was the point of you going there just to support yeah support him because for instance during my birthday it was there it came all the way from the US and while there I don't think it would remember him but it was their very quiet guy like that so I'm going there as well to support him ah that's nice so that's it that's why I'm gonna have sent you found it jump full full benefit when you fly into Lagos after that goes on then get transport to the West today village where I come from which is further West so how far is it from from the airport oh ah it will be like 200 two 150 miles wow yeah something like that yeah but then you know that's not OK say is 150 miles 150 miles which is not too much it's about 5 hours yeah yeah yeah that's still a lot after your flight but again your flat is like 66 oz Charles be yes but yeah yeah yeah if I get any morning very early in the morning and yeah yeah it means that I still have some daylight by the time I get to the village maybe get there by well usually by 5 because it's it's not it's a long journey because the roads are bad and there could be some adventures on the way ah you mean they're gonna kidnap you I hope not but they're gonna yeah but you remember right if you are travelling and you get all these silly checkpoints you do have that don't you yeah but we only have have military past and a convoy that goes ahead of us I don't have anything pass so all those cheques yeah they're gonna be stopping and taking bribes from us do I did last night they stop when they stop me is it how are you going to bless me because it's writing me to bless you OK I started praying that won't wash I started praying and he said just go just go 'cause I knew if I had given him money yeah this was in Nigeria if I give him money the next point is going to bring his body and say this guy is coming probably not it's not maybe they will do that who knows but no but yeah in Nigeria the only ones you get in Poland and Oh yes of course I didn't know that when I drove to Poland many moons ago yeah they stopped us there the Polish code they were telling her that we need to give money they took money off us we were only kids then we went to next check where they stop this again long time ago that what we did was we put the money under the carpet and just said look we've got no money to give it everybody yeah yeah that's how it went I wouldn't be surprised if these countries still do it yeah yeah between Serbia and Poland it's human nature isn't it and they have to make their their money like in india you so for you is your money yes yeah so it's the same thing so yoga I have to go in 2 minutes OK but I'm really glad you called thank you very much I just wanted to make sure I reached out checking before you disappear so we can have help from you I was thinking about you and I'm going to bring this
