Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002AE998C2E50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')': /simple/requests/
==============π=°°

This error message typically indicates a network connectivity issue when trying to use `pip` to install a package. Here’s a breakdown of the error components and potential solutions:

1. **Error Explanation:**
   - `Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None))`: This part indicates that there are no retries left for the connection attempt. The `total=0` means it won't retry anymore.
   - `connection broken by 'NewConnectionError'`: This suggests that a new connection could not be established.
   - `Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed'`: This indicates a DNS error, meaning the system could not resolve the hostname for the URL provided.

2. **Potential Causes:**
   - **Internet Connectivity:** Your internet connection might be down or unstable.
   - **DNS Issues:** There might be a problem with your DNS server, preventing hostname resolution.
   - **Firewall or Proxy Settings:** A firewall or proxy might be blocking the connection.
   - **Incorrect URL or Configuration:** There might be a typo or misconfiguration in your pip settings or the URL you are trying to access.

3. **Solutions:**
   - **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure your device is connected to the internet and that other websites are accessible.
   - **Verify DNS Settings:** Try changing your DNS settings to use a public DNS server like Google’s (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare’s (1.1.1.1).
   - **Adjust Firewall/Proxy Settings:** Check if your firewall or proxy settings are blocking pip. You might need to adjust these settings or use the `--proxy` option with pip if behind a proxy.
   - **Update pip Configuration:** Ensure that the pip configuration is correct. You can reset or update pip to the latest version using:
     ```sh
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - **Use a Different Source:** Try using a different package index or mirror by adding the `--index-url` option:
     ```sh
     pip install <package_name> --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
     ```

If you continue to experience issues, providing more details about your environment (e.g., operating system, pip version, network setup) might help in diagnosing the problem further.

To install a Python package from a downloaded file, you can use `pip` with the path to the downloaded package file. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Download the Package:**
   - Download the package file (typically a `.whl` file or a `.tar.gz` archive) from a trusted source like the Python Package Index (PyPI).

2. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal:**
   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the package file.

3. **Install the Package:**
   - Use `pip` to install the package. Replace `<package_file>` with the name of the downloaded file.

For a `.whl` (wheel) file:
```sh
pip install <package_file>.whl
```

For a `.tar.gz` (source distribution) file:
```sh
pip install <package_file>.tar.gz
```

### Example
If you downloaded a package file named `example_package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`, you would run:
```sh
pip install example_package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

If you downloaded a package file named `example_package-1.0.0.tar.gz`, you would run:
```sh
pip install example_package-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

### Additional Tips
- **Ensure pip is up to date:**
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- **Install dependencies manually if needed:** Sometimes, the downloaded package might have dependencies that also need to be installed. You can manually download and install these dependencies in a similar manner.

By following these steps, you should be able to install a package from a downloaded file without needing an internet connection.
