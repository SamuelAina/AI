Hi team,

I recently changed my password, and since there are scripts for automatic file downloads that require user authentication, I needed to update the scripts following the procedure outlined in the attached email.

I am sharing this information so that other team members can update the scripts with their own credentials if I am unavailable to do so.

Please note that for Ratan file downloads, the person activating the script must have access to each of the report files on the report platform [INSERT URL HERE].

Best regards,
