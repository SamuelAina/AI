I have several articles that are talking about Binance Cryptocurrency. I want to formulate a risk score for Binance which I can aggregate over days, weeks and months I also want to agreegate risk score by source of the article (e.g. Financial Times, New York Time, BBC etc). How can I go about doing this?

To formulate a risk score for Binance based on news articles, you can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow:
        1. Data Collection: Collect news articles related to Binance from various sources, such as Financial Times, New York Times, BBC, and other reliable news sources. You can use web scraping techniques or APIs to collect the articles.
        2. Preprocessing: Clean the collected data by removing stop words, punctuations, and converting all text to lowercase. You can use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for this task.
        3. Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of each article using a sentiment analysis model. You can train a machine learning model using a dataset like IMDB or use a pre-trained model like VaderSentiment.
        4. Risk Score Calculation: Calculate a risk score for each article based on its sentiment. You can use a simple approach like assigning a score of -1 for negative sentiment, 0 for neutral sentiment, and 1 for positive sentiment.
        5. Aggregation: Aggregate the risk scores by source, day, week, and month. You can use pandas for data manipulation and grouping.
        6. Visualization: Visualize the risk scores over time to identify trends and patterns. You can use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization.
        7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your sentiment analysis model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 # Load the data
articles = pd.read_csv('binance_articles.csv')
 # Preprocess the data
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
articles['sentiment'] = articles['text'].apply(sia.polarity_scores)
 # Calculate the risk score
articles['risk_score'] = np.where(articles['sentiment'] > 0, 1, 0)
 # Aggregate the risk scores by source
source_risk_scores = articles.groupby('source').agg({'risk_score': 'sum'})
 # Aggregate the risk scores by day, week, and month
date_risk_scores = articles.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='date', freq='D')).agg({'risk_score': 'sum'})
week_risk_scores = articles.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='date', freq='W')).agg({'risk_score': 'sum'})
month_risk_scores = articles.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='date', freq='M')).agg({'risk_score': 'sum'})
 # Visualize the risk scores
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sources = source_risk_scores.index
for i, source in enumerate(sources):
    plt.subplot(3, 1, i+1)
    plt.plot(date_risk_scores[source].values)
    plt.plot(week_risk_scores[source].values, label='Weekly')
    plt.plot(month_risk_scores[source].values, label='Monthly')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title(source)
plt.show()
creating issues reports in geo-economic, political, environmental and technology domains.

=======================================
I have a 4 x 4 grid.
The value in each cell is identified as X(R,C) where R is the row number and C is the column number.
Randomly fill the grid with integers from 1 to 100 ensuring the following constraint:
Skipping X(1,1), X(R,C)=X(1,C)+X(R,1)  Or X(1,C)=X(R,C)+X(R,1) or X(R,1)=X(1,C)+X(R,C) 

Give me the table of the grid.
