The attached spreadsheet contains relevant information about the trackers.

All trackers, except the DPL AvF Tracker, have been successfully migrated from CD01 to CD04.

The DPL AvF Tracker faces some complex dependencies related to its reporting interface. I will collaborate with Raja to resolve these issues as soon as possible.

The decision to continue supporting or phasing out any of these trackers will depend on discussions with their respective business owners. The contact emails I have provided are the key points of contact as of now.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.
