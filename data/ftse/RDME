Thank you for your response.

As we prepare for the migration, could you please check if itâ€™s possible to connect the reporting system to SGWPAUPCD04.[Tracker_DPL_AvF].dbo.[sp_Report_DPL_AvF_BreakDetail_svr] instead of SGWPAPPCD01.[Tracker_DPL_AvF].dbo.[sp_Report_DPL_AvF_BreakDetail]?

The stored procedure *sp_Report_DPL_AvF_BreakDetail_svr* has an extra parameter, @SVR, which lets us switch between SGWPAPPCD01 and SGWPAUPCD04, with the default being SGWPAPPCD01. This will make the migration smoother.

Please confirm if the connection to SGWPAUPCD04 works, so I can update the stored procedures accordingly.
