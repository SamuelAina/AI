I wanted to check in with you regarding the Trackers in my "Book of Work."

As you may know, these are web-based user interface applications developed and maintained by our team, used by various stakeholders for tracking and workflow purposes.

In Steve Enefers's absence, I propose including you (as I did with Steve) in some of the user requests for maintenance and support. This way, you can stay informed and intervene if any requests deviate from your expectations or the team's objectives.

Please let me know if this works for you.
