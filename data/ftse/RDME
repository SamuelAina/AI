I want to devide a list of items into pages. The items are in consecutive sequence of row id starting with 1 and the increasing by step of 1. Total number of items is @totalNumberOfEntries, number of entries per pages is @entriesPerPage, current page is @pageNo. The first item row id for a page is @firstItemOfPage and the last item for that page is @lastItemOfPage. Give me the T-SQL expression for @firstItemOfPage and @lastItemOfPage

SET @firstItemOfPage = ((@pageNo - 1) * @entriesPerPage) + 1;
SET @lastItemOfPage = MIN(@pageNo * @entriesPerPage, @totalNumberOfEntries);

DESCRIPTION
An app that lets the users type in a statement which the app analises ant determines --if the statement is relevant to finance
--If the phrasing of the statement is appropriate in terms of risks and propertary
--Scores the statement for appropriateness on the scale of 1 (good) to 9 (bad)

+++++++++++++++++

This application offers a unique platform where users can input a statement for analysis. The app evaluates the statement to discern its relevance to financial matters. It then assesses the statement's phrasing, focusing on risk and proprietary language. Each statement is rated on a scale from 1 (good) to 9 (bad), reflecting its appropriateness. Additionally, the app suggests alternative phrasing options that are more suitable. The user interface features a text input area, with results displayed directly below. For added convenience, the app maintains a history of previously entered statements and their evaluations, accessible at the bottom of the interface.
+++++++++++++++
To enhance the functionality and appeal of the app, several core features can be added:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Enhancements**: Implement advanced NLP algorithms to improve the accuracy of analysis in determining the relevance to finance and assessing the risk level in phrasing.

2. **Customization Options**: Allow users to set specific parameters or preferences for analysis, such as industry-specific jargon, regional financial norms, or different levels of risk tolerance.

3. **Real-Time Suggestions**: Integrate a feature that provides real-time suggestions for improvement as the user types, rather than only after the statement is submitted.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Include sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of the statement, such as positive, negative, or neutral, which is particularly useful in financial communications.

5. **Integration with Financial Databases**: Connect the app with up-to-date financial databases and news sources to provide context-specific analysis based on current market conditions or financial trends.

6. **Multi-Language Support**: Expand the appâ€™s capabilities to include multiple languages, catering to a global user base.

7. **Voice-to-Text Feature**: Incorporate a voice-to-text function for users who prefer speaking over typing, enhancing accessibility.

8. **Personalized Feedback History**: Create a more interactive history section where users can see their progress over time, including improvements in their phrasing and risk assessments.

9. **Interactive Learning Module**: Add an educational component that teaches users about financial terminology, risk communication, and effective phrasing.

10. **API Integration**: Develop an API for the app, allowing it to be integrated with other software or platforms, such as financial planning tools or business communication systems.

11. **User Community and Forums**: Establish a user community or forums within the app for sharing best practices, advice, and experiences related to financial statement composition.

12. **Data Security and Privacy Enhancements**: Strengthen data protection measures, ensuring user statements and history are securely stored and handled, which is crucial for financial information.

These additions can significantly increase the app's value to users, making it not only a tool for analysis but also a comprehensive platform for learning and improving financial communication.
