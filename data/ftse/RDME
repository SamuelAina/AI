To perform a GET request with integrated authentication using `curl`, you need to specify the appropriate options based on the type of authentication required. Here's how you can do it for some common authentication methods:

### Basic Authentication
```sh
curl -u username:password https://api.example.com/data
```
- `-u username:password`: This option specifies the username and password for basic authentication.

### Bearer Token Authentication
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" https://api.example.com/data
```
- `-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"`: This option sets the `Authorization` header with a bearer token.

### NTLM Authentication
```sh
curl --ntlm -u username:password https://api.example.com/data
```
- `--ntlm`: This option enables NTLM authentication.
- `-u username:password`: Specifies the username and password for NTLM authentication.

### Kerberos (Negotiate) Authentication
```sh
curl --negotiate -u : https://api.example.com/data
```
- `--negotiate`: This option enables GSS-Negotiate authentication.
- `-u :`: With `--negotiate`, the `-u` option requires a colon but the username and password are handled by the Kerberos ticket.

### Using Cookies for Authentication
If you need to send cookies for authentication, you can use the `--cookie` option:
```sh
curl --cookie "name=value" https://api.example.com/data
```
- `--cookie "name=value"`: Sends a cookie with the request.

### Including All Options Together
If your API requires multiple headers and options, you can combine them:
```sh
curl -u username:password --cookie "name=value" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" https://api.example.com/data
```
This command will:
- Use basic authentication with `-u username:password`
- Send a cookie with `--cookie "name=value"`
- Include a bearer token with `-H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"`

### Example of a Complex Request
Here's an example of a more complex request with multiple headers and integrated authentication:
```sh
curl --ntlm -u username:password --cookie "sessionid=abc123" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.example.com/data
```
This command performs an NTLM-authenticated GET request, sends a session cookie, includes a bearer token, and sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

By using the appropriate options with `curl`, you can handle various types of integrated authentication for your API requests.

Given the following sequence of numbers, how likely is the next term goint to increase by 5% over the starting term? Give me the likely percentage increase.
1,2,3,4,5, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
**********
def likelihood_increase_by_5_percent(sequence):
    # Determine the starting term
    starting_term = sequence[0]
    
    # Calculate the threshold for 5% increase
    threshold = starting_term * 1.05
    
    # Count the number of terms greater than or equal to the threshold
    count = sum(1 for term in sequence if term >= threshold)
    
    # Calculate the likelihood percentage
    likelihood_percentage = (count / len(sequence)) * 100
    
    return likelihood_percentage

# Example usage
sequence = [8, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3]
result = likelihood_increase_by_5_percent(sequence)
print(f"The likelihood that the next term will increase by 5% or more over the starting term is {result:.2f}%")
