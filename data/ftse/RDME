I just wanted to check with you regarding the Trackers in my "Book of work".

As you may be aware, these are web based user interface applications developed and maintained by our team, used by various people for tracking and workflow scenarios.

In Steve Enefers's absense I would propose that I include you (as I did with Steve) in some of the requests from users for maintenance and support so that you are aware and can intervene if any of the requests does not comply with your idea or expectation of what the team should be doing.

Please le me know if this is okay with you.
