I believe the reason I didn’t make much progress with this request was that I wasn’t entirely clear on what you were asking for. Additionally, I don’t have Visual Studio 2012 or 2015 available.

Regarding **gspc_tbl**, I don’t think we should modify it, as it’s already being used in other parts of the code. Perhaps you could create a new version, **gspc_tbl_jsn**, that outputs JSON instead of text, and use that for your download page.

As for the **PCWorkspace** in the virtual folder, the C# source has already been compiled into a DLL. Could you share a copy of the actual C# code? That would help me gain better insight.
