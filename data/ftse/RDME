Hi 
I understand you want us to develop a tracker like the Deal Tracker.

1, the best approch is to base your tracker on an existing one, althougfh your requirements will alway be different.
2, you need to decide which data fields you wnt to capture and provide us with the list, together with data definition.
3, there are currently over 20 trackers each of them with their own unique features. The most successful among them are the ones where there is a willing and knowlwdgible member of the owning team who acts a a busuness analyst and works with the developer to facilitate the project. This is very important to make the project work.
5, Some of the important features of the tracker:
1, capture of important data with auidit trail of changes to them
2, security 
access control
- user role assinment/management
- control over what records users can see based on a specified key field
- control over which fields users can see based on assigned role

4, Please provide the following initial information regarding the proposed tracker:
Name and contact of business analyst from your team.
Name of the tracker
Main purpose of the tracker
Key fields you want to capture: (Sample list is provided based on Deal Tracker)

Once this is recieved we can begin working on a prototype that we can work with your business analyst to develop a fully working tracker.
