Subject: Assistance Needed for AvF Tracker Migration from CD01 to CD04

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I need your help to complete the migration of the AvF Tracker from CD01 to CD04. We were unable to finalize the migration, primarily due to connectivity issues with XLCubed reports. Although we started working on the connection, it remains incomplete.

Could you please provide me with the stored procedures behind the reports so I can make the necessary adjustments?

Hereâ€™s the list of reports accessed from the tracker:

1. Exec Summary  
   [Link]

2. Regional/Product Summary  
   [Link]

3. Status Report  
   [Link]

4. FX Report  
   [Link]

5. AvF Rec Report  
   [Link]

6. Daily FX Predictor  
   [Link]

7. FY 2013 AvF  
   [Link]

8. AvF Exec Summary - Power BI Report Server (scb.net)  
   [Link]

Additionally, I noticed there are some DataMart-based tables and views used for further reporting. I will need your assistance to re-establish connectivity with these as part of the migration.

Please let me know when you're available to discuss this.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
